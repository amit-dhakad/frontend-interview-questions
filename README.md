It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React was created by [Jordan Walke](https://github.com/jordwalke), a software engineer working for Facebook. React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.

 1. ### What do you understand by pseudo element in CSS?
 
      A CSS pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s). For example, ::first-line can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.
      
      ## Syntax
      ```css
      selector::pseudo-element {
        property: value;
       }
      ```
      
      ```css
      /* The first line of every <p> element. */
        p::first-line {
        color: blue;
       text-transform: uppercase;
      }
      ```
